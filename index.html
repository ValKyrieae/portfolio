                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Kyrie! I'm a U.S. Air Force veteran, an upcoming college graduate, and a lifelong technology enthusiast. My passion for tech started early with video games and a fascination for how systems work — a curiosity that eventually led me to build my own custom PC and dive deeper into cybersecurity, software, and hardware.</p>

                <p>Through my academic and professional journey, I've developed skills in cybersecurity, network traffic analysis, incident response, and cloud technologies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. I'm Security+ certified and trained with tools like WireShark, Autopsy, and Cisco Packet Tracer, and I've built a strong foundation working with Linux and Windows server environments.</p>

                <p>While serving in the Air Force, I was proud to be recognized as an Honor Graduate from Airman Leadership School and awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal for outstanding service and leadership. These experiences shaped my commitment to teamwork, attention to detail, and always striving for excellence — traits I now carry into every project I work on.</p>

                <p>I'm passionate about solving problems, learning new technologies, and making systems more efficient and secure. Thanks for visiting my portfolio — I’m excited to keep growing and contributing to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
